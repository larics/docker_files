Dockers are not used widely on raspberryPi. Therefore I won't use it for know because they're lacking GUI support which is 
absolutely crucial for HMI project for which I plan to use this raspberry. 

There is [this link](https://blog.tomhanoldt.info/dev/docker/docker-on-raspberry-with-gui/) that explains how to setup GUI with docker with portainer, but it could possibly introduce too much of a latency.

Currently used Raspbian is Buster and I've installed ROS melodic.
