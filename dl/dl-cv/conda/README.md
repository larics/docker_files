# ROS-conda 

Combination of ROS and conda is implemented because most of the 
SOTA DL algorithms use conda to setup environment. 

With the clever setup of the shebang, we can configure ROS 
nodes to run on conda python, therefore enabling easier 
setup and inclusion of the DL models in the ROS nodes.
